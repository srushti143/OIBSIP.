<p> <strong> Babbage is considered by some to be "father of the computer".
Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine,
that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential 
ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine,
programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom.
Babbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street, Marylebone, where he died,
at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871; he was buried in London's Kensal Green Cemetery.
According to Horsley, Babbage died "of renal inadequacy, secondary to cystitis."
